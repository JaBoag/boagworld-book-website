<p>Encouraging Clicks taught me about the human psychology and mental models and why optimizing the page load with user in mind makes so much more sense in order to improve conversions.</p>

<p>This is a great book on how to practically, and ethically, optimise website conversion rates. Before, I was roughly aware of what CRO was, but now I feel confident to start implementing these techniques in projects. As you would expect, Paul explains all of the concepts in an easy-to-follow and friendly manner.</p>

<p>I picked up a super simple testing idea, and saw a 42% lift in conversion rate. It was surprising to me, so I ran it again to significance with the same result. That equates to about 2.5 million USD/year in revenue at no additional cost. So I’d say I got my money’s worth!</p>

<h2>About the Book</h2>

<p>The web has become a noisy place with millions of organisations like yours trying to get the attention of users. </p>

<p>That has led to many resorting to increasingly desperate techniques to encourage users to act on their website. We have seen an explosion of dark patterns attempting to manipulate users into handing over personal data or make a purchase.</p>

<p>However, these manipulative techniques come with hidden costs in customer service, maintenance, support, return processing fees, and social media backlash.</p>

<p>How then do we encourage users to act? If dark patterns are not the answer, then what is? These are the questions that Click! answers. </p>

<p>Click! shows you how to improve conversion sustainably with practical advice and techniques you can apply tomorrow.</p>
<div>

<ul>
	<li>The psychology of decision making.</li>
	<li>How to persuade people without alienating them. </li>
	<li>Methods for building trust and addressing user concerns.</li>

	<li>Long term strategies for improving your conversion rates.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>That makes this an ideal book for anybody who is looking to encourage users to act, without resorting to unethical and ultimately damaging techniques.</p>

<p>Whether you are a designer, marketer, entrepreneur or product owner, this book will help.</p>

<p>It will help you meet your targets, improve the user experience and convince your colleagues, clients and managers that they do not need to resort to manipulation.</p>
